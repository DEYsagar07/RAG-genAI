# üß† RAG: Retrieval-Augmented Generation
# Overview:
This project demonstrates the implementation of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), an architecture that enhances large language models with access to external knowledge sources, enabling more accurate and contextually aware responses.

# üîç How It Works
# User Input (Question):
A user submits a natural language question.

# Context Retrieval (Fetch / Retrieve Relevant Information):
The system queries a knowledge base (e.g., a vector database or traditional DB) to fetch relevant context related to the question.

# Fusion of Question and Context:
The retrieved context is combined with the original user question to create a more informative input for the language model.

# Gemini (LLM Inference):
This enhanced input is passed to Gemini, a powerful large language model, which uses the contextual information to generate an accurate and grounded response.

# Answer Generation:
The final answer, now contextually enriched, is returned to the user.

# üîó Components
Gemini: Google‚Äôs generative AI model used for answer generation.
Database (DB): Stores relevant documents or data to be retrieved.
Retriever Module: Responsible for searching and selecting the most relevant data chunks.
Fusion Module: Combines question and context.
User Interface: Accepts input and displays the final output.

# ‚úÖ Benefits of RAG
Reduces hallucinations by grounding answers in real data.
Enables up-to-date and domain-specific knowledge integration.
Scales well across use cases like customer support, legal QA, finance, and more.
